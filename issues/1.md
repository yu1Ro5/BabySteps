### Title:
Error Encountered in GitHub Actions Workflow "iOS Build & TestFlight Auto"

### Body:
#### Description:
The GitHub Actions workflow "iOS Build & TestFlight Auto" has encountered the following errors:

1. The "Info.plist" file is not being found, likely due to an incorrect search path or it being missing entirely.
2. A conflicting code signing identity is set for the target "BabySteps" in the Xcode project. The project is automatically signed for development but also specifies a manual iPhone Distribution identity.

#### Suggested Actions:
a) Verify the correct location and presence of "Info.plist" in the repository, and update the workflow to correctly locate it.  
b) Resolve the conflicting code signing identity in the Xcode project settings, ensuring consistent signing behavior.
