### Description
The GitHub Actions workflow "iOS Build & TestFlight Auto" is encountering issues related to code signing and build failure.

#### Issues Identified
1. **Conflicting Code Signing Identity**
   - Description: The target "BabySteps" has conflicting provisioning settings. It is automatically signed for development but also specifies a manual iPhone Distribution identity.
   - Suggested Action: Update the Xcode project signing settings to ensure there are no conflicts. Use either automatic signing or manual signing consistently.

2. **Build Failure**
   - Description: The project fails to build with error code 65 during the archive step.
   - Suggested Action: Review the build logs to identify the root cause of the failure. Ensure all dependencies are correctly configured, and there are no missing build settings.
